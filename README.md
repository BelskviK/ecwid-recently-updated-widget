# Recently Updated Products Widget

A plug-and-play Ecwid app that:

- Shows the **N most recently updated products** on the cart page
- Lets owners **toggle** the widget, set the **default N**, and **export products** to CSV/XLSX
- Runs anywhere with a single `docker compose up`

## Quick Start (local dev)

```bash
cp .env.example .env            # put your creds if needed
yarn install                    # installs root + workspaces
yarn dev                        # parallel client & server
